### MadGraph5 tutorial
### 2021/08/02 written by Shih Lin
MadGraph is a simulation that can draw Feynman diagram of siganl
It doesn't include hadronization of the collision.(Hadronization is included in Pythia)
It only care about the specific process you want.

#step1 enter Madgraph5

	cd MG5_aMC_v3_1_1/

#step2 execute madgraph5

	./bin/mg5_aMC
	--> MG5_aMC> 

#step3 input your process

	MG5_aMC>generate p p > t t~

		exit
	
		./bin/generate_events

#step4 after generating

	MG5_aMC>output -f
		output direction: Output to directory /Users/zero/work/MG5_aMC_v3_1_1/PROC_sm_0 done.

#step5 go to the output direction

	cd /Users/zero/work/MG5_aMC_v3_1_1/PROC_sm_0/Events/run_01/
	--> You can see the lhe file in the directory
	
	vim LHE file
	--> See all information about all events
